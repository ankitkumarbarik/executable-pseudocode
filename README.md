# Data Structures & Algorithms — Implementation Log

A minimal, disciplined repository for learning **Data Structures & Algorithms**
with a **pseudocode-first mindset**.

C and C++ are used only as **implementation tools** —
to express logic clearly, close to how algorithms are actually thought about.

This is not a language showcase.
This is about **how to think**, not which syntax to use.

---

## Intent

- Treat code as **executable pseudocode**
- Focus on **logic, invariants, and data movement**
- Build intuition from first principles
- Separate *understanding* from *language details*

---

## What This Repo Is

- A personal **learning log**
- Step-by-step DSA implementations
- Code written for **clarity over cleverness**
- Iterative refinement as understanding improves

---

## What This Repo Is Not

- Not a tutorial
- Not optimized for beginners
- Not language-specific
- Not a copy of standard solutions

---

## Approach

> Think in algorithms  
> Write in pseudocode  
> Implement in C / C++  
> Refactor only after correctness

---

## Status

🚧 Continuously evolving  
Code and structure may change as concepts mature.

---

## Note

This repository exists to document **how my understanding evolves**.

If you read it:
- Don’t trust it blindly
- Don’t memorize it
- Re-derive it yourself

That’s the point.
